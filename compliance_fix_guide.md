# Guide to Fixing Non-Compliant AI Policies

## Common Compliance Issues and Solutions

### 1. Missing Core Requirements

#### Problem: Low Core Principles Score
- Missing transparency mentions
- Weak accountability measures
- Limited ethical considerations

#### Solution Steps:
1. Add explicit transparency statements:
   ```text
   "Our AI systems maintain transparency through clear documentation of decision-making processes and regular stakeholder communications."
   ```

2. Strengthen accountability:
   ```text
   "We maintain clear accountability through defined roles, responsibilities, and regular audits of AI systems."
   ```

3. Enhance ethical framework:
   ```text
   "Ethical considerations guide all aspects of our AI development, supported by regular ethical impact assessments."
   ```

### 2. Weak Risk Management

#### Problem: Poor Risk Framework
- Basic security only
- Limited monitoring
- Missing governance structure

#### Solution Steps:
1. Enhance risk assessment:
   ```text
   "Comprehensive risk assessments are conducted regularly, covering technical, ethical, and social impacts."
   ```

2. Strengthen security:
   ```text
   "Security measures are implemented based on thorough risk assessments and industry best practices."
   ```

3. Add governance:
   ```text
   "A robust governance framework oversees all AI operations, ensuring accountability and compliance."
   ```

### 3. Inadequate Privacy & Fairness

#### Problem: Missing Protection Measures
- Limited privacy controls
- Weak fairness measures
- No bias prevention

#### Solution Steps:
1. Add privacy protections:
   ```text
   "Privacy protection is paramount, with strict controls and regular impact assessments."
   ```

2. Strengthen fairness:
   ```text
   "Fairness is ensured through regular assessments and bias prevention measures."
   ```

3. Address bias:
   ```text
   "Active bias prevention and monitoring ensures fair treatment across all user groups."
   ```

## Integration Checklist
